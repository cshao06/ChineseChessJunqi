# ChineseChessJunqi
A self-designed chess game written in C++ with Qt. It combines movement of Chinese Chess pieces and the fog of war (hidden information of the opponent) mechanism of another Chinese strategy game called Junqi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luzhanqi), which is similar to Stratego.

Can be built for multiple platforms (tested on Windows, MacOS and Android ... 6-7 years ago)
